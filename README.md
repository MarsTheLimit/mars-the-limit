# Mars the Limit

######Where are we??
Mars the Limit is in Marion Iowa, and is run by a 13 year old (me). 
We are still in a developing stage, so the website is kinda bad as of
2/25/2022. 

######What do we do?
I code a few Python games (with pygame), and convert them to .exe standalone games,
and then put them on this website so people can have some fun. I also code in HTML,
CSS, and enough JavaScript. 

We also help the world by fighting the lawnmower rights activists ([LMRA](https://lmra-org.web.app) with the [NLMR](https://marsthelimit.github.io/nlmr-web/index.html).
