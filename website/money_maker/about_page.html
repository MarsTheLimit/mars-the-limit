<p> Hello, there! This platform will solve all of the world's problems. If you need money, simply click on the link! People won't go hungry anymore, and
everyone will be just peachy. If you have any questions, don't forget to go to the contact page.
</p>
<p>The World Money People (WMP) have just recently launched and are working on another page for food, and another following will be for water. If people 
are finding this website, then our efforts are working, and we might not have to go to war over resources. If our coal generator works, then we won't have to worry 
about wasting electricity. We are aren't going to make you pay for anything, but donations really makes our day!
</p>
<p>Our team of one person really works together well, and the team always seems to know what the other is thinking. We love to make the world a little happier 
everyday, and plan to keep working for a long time. Again, we are under heavy development, so donations would be nice! We currently have no adress, this is being 
made in a sewer in New York, so as you pass by, drop a few hundred in. We are aiming for a cardboard box, then a tool shed, and then we might be able to get a house, 
or at least a rooftop camp.
